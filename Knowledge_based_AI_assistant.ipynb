            "*   **Use daily stand-ups:** (Implied: Keep them short and focused)\n",
            "*   **Set clear OKRs:** (Objectives and Key Results) This provides a clear direction and allows you to measure progress.\n",
            "*   **Encourage time-blocking:** Schedule specific blocks of time for particular tasks.\n",
            "*   **Apply Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused bursts (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks.\n",
            "*   **Set SMART goals:** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) This ensures your goals are well-defined and attainable.\n",

Continuously being updated with improved context understanding, multi-line suggestions, and enhanced security features. Recent updates focus on natural language understanding and integration with GitHub's collaboration tools.\n",
            "*   **Tabnine:** A mature AI coding assistant that focuses on privacy and security, offering on-premise and self-hosted options. It supports various languages and IDEs. Recent updates have improved its code completion accuracy and added support for more niche languages.\n",
            "*   **Amazon CodeWhisperer:** Integrated into AWS, offering serverless functions and suggestions based on existing code. Recent updates include better integration with AWS services and improved support for infrastructure-as-code.\n",
            "*   **Codeium:** Free AI-powered code completion tool, offers features like chat and search. The free price makes it particularly attractive.\n",

            "**What to Consider When Choosing:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Language Support:** Ensure the assistant supports the languages you primarily use.\n",
            "*   **IDE Integration:** Seamless integration with your preferred IDE is crucial.\n",
            "*   **Pricing:** Some are subscription-based, while others offer free tiers.  Consider your budget.\n",
            "*   **Privacy and Security:** If you're working with sensitive code, look for options with robust privacy features or on-premise deployment.\n",
            "*   **Accuracy and Context Awareness:** The quality of suggestions can vary. Look for assistants that learn from your coding style and provide contextually relevant recommendations.\n",
            "*   **Learning Curve:** Some assistants are easier to set up and use than others.\n",
            "\n",
